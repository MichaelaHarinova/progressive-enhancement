    <h2>The story</h2>
    Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around
    to commiserate. They said, <q class="villagers">We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most
    unfortunate.</q>The
    farmer said,<q class="farmer"> <em>Maybe.</em></q> The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with
    it, and
    in the
    evening everybody came back and said,<q class="villagers"> Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You
    now have eight
    horses!</q> The farmer again said,<q class="farmer"><em>Maybe.</em></q>
    The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his
    leg. The neighbors then said,<q class="villagers"> Oh dear, that’s too <i class="bad">bad </i></q> and the farmer
    responded,<q class="farmer"><strong>Maybe.</strong></q>
    The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son
    because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said,<q class="villagers"> Isn’t that
    great!</q> Again, he
    said,<q class="farmer"><strong>Maybe.</strong></q>

    The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell
    whether anything that happens in it is <i class="good">good </i> or <i class="bad">bad </i> — because you never
    know what will be the consequence of the
    misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of <i class="good">good </i>fortune.

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p><i class="good">Good </i> and <i class="bad">Bad </i> are just one perspective. Bananas are <i
            class="good">good </i>
        for monkeys, but monkeys are not <i class="good">good </i> for bananas. Let's
        not make a big deal out of it...
